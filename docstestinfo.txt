The legal documents provided in this folder are AI generated based on starting prompts for testing purposes with fictional characters involved. I am not well versed with law paradigms so I did not format check the material at hand.

For simplicity I am using .txt files. I am completely aware that in a professional setting we would be dealing with PDFs and Word Docs.

There is no auth so all of these files are VALID context for the LLM chatbot.


For full disclosure here is the prompt I used (on GPT 4)

Can you create some mock legal documents? 
I will provide some cases for you to consider:

1- Famous monarch of cryptography "Shah 256" sues democratic cryptographic algorithm for defamation. 
2- Local rat gets charged as he breaches company nondisclosure contract and allegedly discusses "cheese" with other rats. 
3- Travel guide fined for calling kong skull island a "walk in the park" and not clearly specifying it as being a walk in "Jurassic Park" 
4- Famous psychologist Sykik Waard publicly admits to his racist remarks being a freudian slip, but later remarks that this was in fact not a freudian slip.
