Case No. 2025‑PSY‑404

Testimony of Freud Historian Dr. C. Jungson

“A Freudian slip is an unconscious reveal of truth. The doctor claimed it was a slip, then un‑slipped it later, which is without precedent. It’s like knocking over a vase and then verbally insisting it was never knocked over while staring at the broken pieces.”

Testimony of Clinical Therapist

“When someone backtracks this hard on a Freudian slip, it usually means the second statement is the real slip covering the first slip. It’s slips all the way down.”

Testimony of the Respondent (Dr. Sykik Waard)

“I maintain that my clarification was the true statement. Or perhaps the first one was. Or maybe the clarification of the clarification. Look — sometimes the unconscious is just being dramatic.”
