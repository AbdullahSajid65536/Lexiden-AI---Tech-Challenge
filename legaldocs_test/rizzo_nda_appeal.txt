Case No. 2025‑RAT‑INF‑09

Court of Appeals for Rodent Contract Violations

Appeal Submission by: Rizzo “The Squeak” Tailman

Grounds for Appeal

The Defendant was under duress, specifically:

An environment containing artisanal crackers,

An irresistible aroma of premium dairy,

Peer pressure from highly persuasive rats.

The NDA did not explicitly specify:

That casual conversation about cheese was prohibited “in alleyways after 10 PM.”

Defendant believed all present rodents to be:

Market participants with equal stakes,

Bound by the unwritten “rat honor code.”

Requested Outcome

Reduction of penalties,

Restoration of cheese tasting privileges,

Completion of his community service through:

“Cheese appreciation seminars for underprivileged rats.”

Respectfully submitted,
Rizzo Tailman
Defendant
