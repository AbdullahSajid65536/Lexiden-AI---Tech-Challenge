Case No. 2025‑RAT‑INF‑09

Witness Testimonies
Testimony of Mouse Witness “Nibble McChew”

“I was there that night in the alley. We asked Rizzo what the deal was with the next quarter’s cheddar supply, just joking around. He didn’t hesitate. Just blurted out, ‘Aged two months, sharper, higher melt point.’ We all gasped. That’s serious trade knowledge.”

Testimony of Company Security Officer “Whiskers Jenkins”

“The NDA was clear. Rizzo signed it. I remember because he had cheese dust all over his paws. We trusted him with proprietary cheese development data. And he just … told street rats. You can’t run a competitive rodent‑based industrial dairy operation like that.”

Testimony of Rizzo Tailman (Defendant)

“Look, I didn’t think they’d squeal. Rats are a professional community. I thought the info was safe. Also… they had crackers. I was weak.
