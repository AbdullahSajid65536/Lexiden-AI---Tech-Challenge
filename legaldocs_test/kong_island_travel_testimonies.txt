Case No. 2025‑TOUR‑778

TOURISM BUREAU v. ADVENTURIST TRAVEL GUIDES

Witness Testimonies
Testimony of Disappointed Tourist #1

“The brochure said ‘walk in the park.’ Next thing I know, a dinosaur‑sized crab tries to use me as a drumstick. I didn’t even pack hiking boots. I packed flip‑flops.”

Testimony of Tour Guide from Another Company

“We’ve been warning people for years. Skull Island is not for beginners. You need armor plating or at minimum parkour certification. Calling it casual sightseeing is reckless.”

Testimony of Adventurist Company Rep

“In our defense, some clients like extreme challenges. And technically it is a park … in that it contains wildlife, trees, and gravel in places. We never said the trees wouldn’t want to eat you.”
