Case No. 2025‑CYP‑001

Witness Testimonies:

Testimony of AES‑256 (Expert in Symmetric Security)

“I have known Shah 256 for over two decades. He’s reliable, mathematically principled, and does his job without fanfare. To suggest that he is ‘ceremonial’ is simply inaccurate. I have worked alongside him in encryption systems worldwide and have never once seen him fail to hash with dignity.”

Testimony of MD5 (Retired Algorithm)

“Look, I know what it’s like to lose the public’s confidence. I get it. But Shah isn’t there. He didn’t deteriorate like I did. Not once has he been found sunbathing on the broken‑hash lists. Give the sovereign some respect.”

Testimony of Random Sysadmin

“I don’t know about royal protocols, but every time our servers boot up, Shah is there, dependable, hashing like a real workhorse. If that’s ‘ceremonial,’ then so is the entire IT industry.”
