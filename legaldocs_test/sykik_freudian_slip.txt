Case No. 2025‑PSY‑404

Sykik Waard – Public Professional Review Board Findings

Records of Ethics Hearing

BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGICAL OVERSIGHT AND FREUDIAN ACCIDENTS

Summary

Dr. Sykik Waard, licensed psychological practitioner, made the following public declaration on 10 September 2025:

“My insensitive remarks were the result of a Freudian slip.”

Immediately following this, during a later interview, the Respondent stated:

“Actually, upon reconsideration, that was not a Freudian slip at all.”

Board Analysis

Respondent’s contradictory statements create professional ambiguity:

A Freudian slip, by definition, cannot be “retracted retroactively,”

Denying a Freudian slip may itself be indicative of a secondary Freudian slip,

Which may constitute a meta‑slip under Article 12(c) of the Psychoanalytic Humor Code.

The Board concludes that Respondent must undergo:

6 hours of continuing education in “Freud: The Physics of Saying the Quiet Part Out Loud,”

A written explanation detailing which statement was the slip and why.

Resolution filed for public record.
