DR. SYKIK WAARD – FORMAL APPEAL TO THE BOARD
Appellant:

Dr. Sykik Waard, Licensed Clinical Psychologist

Grounds for Appeal

Case No. 2025‑PSY‑404

The Board’s ruling assumes:

The first statement was a Freudian slip,

The denial was itself a compensatory slip.

Appellant argues this creates a:

“Slip recursion,”

Something not formally recognized in the Diagnostic and Terminological Manual of Psychoanalytic Comedy (DTM‑PC).

Furthermore, the unconscious mind:

May occasionally produce statements that are incorrect,

Or may merely have been trying to make a joke.

Statement from Appellant

“If every denial of a Freudian slip is itself a Freudian slip, then one could argue that all verbal communication is just an infinite loop of psychoanalytic self‑contradiction. I appeal not to avoid accountability, but to avoid forcing the English language into recursive paradox.”

Requested Relief

Reversal of mandatory education requirements,

Replacement with:

A brief literature review on “Freudian Meta‑Slips: Theory and Practice,”

A written decision acknowledging that not all slips slip equally.

Respectfully submitted,
Dr. Sykik Waard
